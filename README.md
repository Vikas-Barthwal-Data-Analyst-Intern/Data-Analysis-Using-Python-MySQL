# Data-Analysis-Using-Python-MySQL
Instagram User Behaviour Analysis


Project Description
This project will help you understand how a real-world database is analyzed using SQL, how to get maximum available insights from the dataset, pre-process the data using python for better upcoming performance, and how a structured query language helps us retrieve useful information from the database.


In this project, you will be working on a real-world dataset to analyze a dataset of user behavior of a highly popular social media platform, Instagram. This project aims on cleaning the dataset, analyze the given dataset, and mine informational quality insights using Python and SQL. 

Step by Step Process of Live Project Execution

Module 1 Data Pre-Processing
In this module, you will query the dataset using structured query language to gain insights from the database. The problem statements to be solved will be provided to you, and you will need to provide the solution for the same using your logic. Different concepts of SQL will be used in this process, such as aggregating the data, grouping the data, ordering the data, etc

Task 1 Data Cleaning For Comments :

Removing Unwanted Columns and Renaming Appropriate Columns for Improved Analysis:

Data Cleaning for Comments is a process of removing unwanted columns and renaming the appropriate columns in a dataset containing comments. It involves identifying and removing irrelevant or redundant columns and renaming the columns to make them more descriptive and consistent with the content of the dataset. This improves the quality and usability of the data for analysis and modeling purposes.


Task 2 Data Cleaning For Follows :


Removing Unwanted Columns and Renaming Appropriate Columns for Improved Analysis: 

Data Cleaning for follows is a process of removing unwanted columns and renaming the appropriate columns in a dataset containing follows. It involves identifying and removing irrelevant or redundant columns and renaming the columns to make them more descriptive and consistent with the content of the dataset. This improves the quality and usability of the data for analysis and modeling purposes.


Task 3 Data Cleaning For Likes :


Removing Unwanted Columns and Renaming Appropriate Columns for Improved Analysis: 

Data Cleaning for follows is a process of removing unwanted columns and renaming the appropriate columns in a dataset containing likes. It involves identifying and removing irrelevant or redundant columns and renaming the columns to make them more descriptive and consistent with the content of the dataset. This improves the quality and usability of the data for analysis and modeling purposes.


Task 4 Data Cleaning For Photo_Tags :


Removing Unwanted Columns and Renaming Appropriate Columns for Improved Analysis: 

Data Cleaning for follows is a process of removing unwanted columns and renaming the appropriate columns in a dataset containing Photo_Tags. It involves identifying and removing irrelevant or redundant columns and renaming the columns to make them more descriptive and consistent with the content of the dataset. This improves the quality and usability of the data for analysis and modeling purposes.




Task 5 Data Cleaning For Photos :


Removing Unwanted Columns and Renaming Appropriate Columns for Improved Analysis: 

Data Cleaning for follows is a process of removing unwanted columns and renaming the appropriate columns in a dataset containing Photos. It involves identifying and removing irrelevant or redundant columns and renaming the columns to make them more descriptive and consistent with the content of the dataset. This improves the quality and usability of the data for analysis and modeling purposes.



Task 6 Data Cleaning For Tags :


Removing Unwanted Columns and Renaming Appropriate Columns for Improved Analysis: 

Data Cleaning for follows is a process of removing unwanted columns and renaming the appropriate columns in a dataset containing Tags. It involves identifying and removing irrelevant or redundant columns and renaming the columns to make them more descriptive and consistent with the content of the dataset. This improves the quality and usability of the data for analysis and modeling purposes.



Task 7 Data Cleaning For Users :


Removing Unwanted Columns and Renaming Appropriate Columns for Improved Analysis: 

Data Cleaning for follows is a process of removing unwanted columns and renaming the appropriate columns in a dataset containing Users. It involves identifying and removing irrelevant or redundant columns and renaming the columns to make them more descriptive and consistent with the content of the dataset. This improves the quality and usability of the data for analysis and modeling purposes.



Task 8 Generate Tables Using The Cleaned Dataset:

Download the cleaned dataset by clicking on the file name from File Explorer: 

Utilize the MySQL database information provided in "Database info" to manually create the following tables for the cleaned dataset

-comments -follows -likes -photo_tags -photos -tags -users How to finish the current Task? Once the database tables are created, input the DB connection details in the "db.py" file, and then click on "Run test" to complete the task.


Module 2: Data Analysis Using SQL:


In this module, you will be working on performing data analysis on the pre-processed data from the previous module and conducting Data Analysis using SQL. You will generate queries for given problem statements. 


Task 1: Write An SQL Query To Solve The Given Problem Statement.
Find the 5 oldest users.

Task 2: Write An SQL Query To Solve The Given Problem Statement.
a). What day of the week do most users register on? 
b). We need to figure out when to schedule an ad campgain

Task 3: Write An SQL Query To Solve The Given Problem Statement.
We want to target our inactive users with an email campaign. Find the users who have never posted a photo.

Task 4: Write An SQL Query To Solve The Given Problem Statement.
We're running a new contest to see who can get the most likes on a single photo. WHO WON?

Task 5: Write An SQL Query To Solve The Given Problem Statement.
Our Investors want to know...How many times does the average user post? (total number of photos/total number of users)

Task 6: Write An SQL Query To Solve The Given Problem Statement.
user ranking by postings higher to lower

Task 7: Write An SQL Query To Solve The Given Problem Statement.
Total Posts by users (longer versionof SELECT COUNT(*)FROM photos)

Task 8: Write An SQL Query To Solve The Given Problem Statement.
Total numbers of users who have posted at least one time

Task 9: Write An SQL Query To Solve The Given Problem Statement.

Task 11: Write An SQL Query To Solve The Given Problem Statement.
We also have a problem with celebrities. Find users who have never commented on a photo

Task 12: Write An SQL Query To Solve The Given Problem Statement.
Are we overrun with bots and celebrity accounts? Find the percentage of our users who have either never commented on a photo or have commented on every photo

Task 13: Write An SQL Query To Solve The Given Problem Statement.
Find users who have ever commented on a photo

Task 14: Write An SQL Query To Solve The Given Problem Statement.
